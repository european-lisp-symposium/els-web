             :description "Transpilers translate between high-level programming languages, providing an efficient alternative to manually porting software from one language to another. With the rise of new programming languages, transpilers are ideal tools to assist the conversion of libraries written in more established programming languages to newer and less popular ones. This process facilitates language adoption and fosters their development.
There are currently many transpilation tools available, however, only some focus on producing human-readable and maintainable code, and only smaller set of these generate code that is indistinguishable from human-written programs. The main benefit is that the generated code can easily be understood and modified by programmers, resulting in improved maintainability.
Julia is a recent programming language that targets some of the application areas of the widely popular Python language. However, the number of libraries available in Julia is still lower than what is provided in Python. We propose a solution that involves the development of a transpiler to generate human-readable Julia code from Python code, to speedup the translation of Python libraries to Julia.")

             :description "Lisp is an exquisite medium for the communication of computational ideas. From our most accurate observations of physical reality up through chemistry, biology, and cognition, the universe seems to be computing itself; modeling and simulating these systems in machines has led to incredible technological wealth.

Deep principles and beautiful abstractions seem to drive these systems, but they have always been hard to discover; and we are floundering at the computational frontiers of intelligence, synthetic biology and control systems for our climate. The only way to push forward is to build powerful tools that can communicate and teach.

This talk will take a tour through SICMUtils, a Lisp system designed as a workshop for conducting serious work in mathematical physics and sharing those explorations in a deeply interactive, multiplayer way. The library’s growth parallels our human scientific history; hopefully tools like this will help us write the next chapter.

             :description "Personal computing devices store more and more loosely arranged data. Each new method of keeping track of your data supposes that you stop using old methods on this data. One of the more stable interfaces for data access is the filesystem API. However, the standard filesystem semantic provides a fixed and limited set of ways to search for data.

QueryFS is a virtual filesystem for POSIX-like systems that compiles user-supplied queries in various DSLs via translation to Common Lisp code and represents the results as directories. The main current use-case is using it to navigate and process data stored or indexed in PostgreSQL with traditional tools (grep, find, vim etc.)

We show how practical usage of QueryFS looks like and what lies behind this.")

             :speakers ("Robert Strandh" "Irène Anne Durand")
             :role (:talk)
             :description "The concept of an environment is mentioned in many places in the Common Lisp standard, but the nature of the object is not specified.
For the purpose of this paper, an environment is a mapping (or several such mappings when there is more than one namespace as is the case for Common Lisp) from names to meanings.

In this paper, we propose a replacement for the environment protocol documented in the book ``Common Lisp the Language, second edition'' by Guy Steele. Rather than returning multiple values as the functions in that protocol do, the protocol suggested in this paper is designed so that functions return instances of standard classes. Accessor functions on those instances supply the information needed by a compiler or any other code walker application.

The advantage of our approach is that a protocol based on generic functions and standard classes is easier to extend in backward-compatible ways than the previous protocol, so that implementations can define additional functionality on these objects. Furthermore, CLOS features such as auxiliary methods can be used on
these objects, making it possible to extend or override functionality provided by the protocol, for implementation-specific purposes.

             :description "You've probably seen uLisp mentioned in the list of languages on the web page of the European Lisp Symposium. But did you actually look at it and use it? With this demonstration, Max-Gerd Retzlaff invites you to do so! uLisp is a version of Lisp designed and authored by David Johnson-Davies as a subset of Common Lisp to run on microcontrollers. Max extended uLisp a bit and has been using it since January 2021 for both fun as well as commercial projects: He has made a hand-held Lisp machine for his nephew, implemented a small client for the Dydra graph database to store sensor readings directly in the database for later analysis and visualization, and even installed a little Lisp computer in his Vespa motor scooter to serve as a more accurate GPS-based speedometer and clock.

More recently, he used uLisp to design and implement a sensor device for an automated IoT device consisting of ten environmental sensors and four controllable power sockets to activate environmental control measures. It is provisioned via Bluetooth (BLE) and communicates with a REST backend over Wi-Fi via HTTPs and schema-based JSON to report sensor readings and to retrieve commands from a controlling smartphone application (developed by a different party) to control the actors or to calibrate the more complicated sensors.

This demonstrates that uLisp is not only fun but mature enough to be used for serious projects and commercial prototypes.

Max-Gerd Retzlaff started to use Common Lisp in 2003 and uses it professionally since 2005.

He studied computer science at the KIT, Germany.

             :description "Lisp is the second oldest programming language, and the first one to value productivity more than raw execution speed. This initial disregard for performance has indeed led to some mind-bogglingly slow implementations, especially in the early days, but modern Lisp compilers such as SBCL have almost fully closed the performance gap to the fastest imperative programming languages. Almost, but not quite: Until now, many loop optimizations and support for single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) programming are still missing in Lisp.

We correct this deficiency with two libraries: The first one is sb-simd, an SBCL-specific library that provides convenient bindings for various SIMD instructions sets. The second one is Loopus, a portable loop optimization framework that works via macros and source to source transformations. The most prominent features of Loopus are its optimization of array accesses and that, on SBCL, it automatically applies SIMD vectorization to certain loops.

We conclude with a performance evaluation for several example programs, and show that Lisp code using our libraries can achieve up to 94\% of the performance of highly optimized C code.")

             :description "While folklore teaches us that closures and objects are two sides of the same coin, they remain quite different in practice, most notably because closures are opaque, the only supported operation being to call them.

In this article we discuss a few cases where we need functions to be less opaque, and propose to satisfy this need by extending our beloved $\lambda$ so as to expose as sorts of record fields some of the variables it captures. These \emph{open closures} are close relatives of CLOS's \emph{funcallable objects} as well as of the \emph{function objects} of traditional object-oriented languages like Java, except that they are functions made to behave like objects rather than the reverse.

We present the design and implementation of such a feature in the context of Emacs Lisp.")

             :description "Being dissatisfied with the way current Common Lisp implementations are written, and with the duplication of system code between different implementations, we started the SICL project in 2008.  The initial idea was to create modules that the creators of Common Lisp implementations could use to create a complete system from an initial minimal core.  But this idea was unsatisfactory because it required each module to be written in a subset of Common Lisp.  So instead, we decided to use the full language to implement these modules, effectively making them useless to an implementation using traditional bootstrapping techniques.  We therefore decided to also create a new Common Lisp implementation (also named SICL), that could use those modules.

A crucial element is a bootstrapping technique that can handle these modules.  In this spirit, we have developed several modules, including an implementation of CLOS which is also an important element of bootstrapping.  Lately, we have increased our level of ambition in that we want to extract those modules as separate (and separately maintained) repositories, which requires us to deal with code during bootstrapping that was not specifically written for SICL.

In our talk, we describe this evolution of ambition, and its consequences to bootstrapping, in more detail.  We also give an overview of several new techniques we created, some of which have been published (at ILC and ELS) and some of which have not.  Finally, we discuss the future of the project, and other projects for which we imagine SICL to be a base.")

The core idea of the project remains similar, instead of creating an Emacs like editor (like lem or Second-Climacs) the goal is to achieve 100%~ API compatibility with the GNU Emacs editor, what this mean is that a package (or .el file) should work almost identical in both editors, which will give us access to MELPA and ELPA packages(the Emacs internal package should already be in Common Lisp).

Bio: My name is Fermin MF, I work as a Common Lisp engineer at RavenPack where my main focus is to maintain and develop new features for the RavenPack API that our clients use to access our data.
  In my spare time, I develop Free Software in gitlab, mainly Emacs packages (like maxima.el) and Common Lisp software (like CEDAR and actor).
  Some of my non-tech interests are chess, history and Chinese martial arts."

             :role (:keynote :demo)
             :description "SICMUtils is a Clojure library designed for interactive exploration of mathematical physics. It is simultaneously a work of persuasive writing, a collection of essays on functional pearls and computational ideas, a stable of workhorse functional abstractions, and a practical place to work and visualize algorithms and physical systems, on a server or in the browser.

How do you build a library like this? This talk will go through the architecture of SICMUtils, based on many of the ideas of \"additive programming\" from Gerald Sussman and Chris Hanson's latest book, Software Design for Flexibility. We'll look at surprising examples of the system becoming easier to extend over time. Clojure's embrace of its host platform lets us use the best modern work in Javascript for visualization, while keeping the horsepower of our servers for real work. Lisp's particular elegance will shine throughout.

Bio:
I'm a researcher at the Mentat Collective, and currently working on a series of interactive, multiplayer computational textbooks for exploring mathematical physics and other forms of modeled reality. I've lived past work-lives at (Google) X, Stripe, Twitter, founded Paddleguru and Racehub; I'm most well known in the software world as the author of Summingbird, Algebird, and SICMUtils, and as the maintainer of Cascalog. I have a secret identity as a mountain athlete and amateur aircraft mechanic, and live with wife Jenna and daughter Juno in Boulder, Colorado.")

             :description "We present a new approach to dialogue specification for Virtual Personal Assistants (VPAs) based on so-called dialogue workflow graphs. Our approach relies on Semantic Web technology (OWL), implemented in Common Lisp with the help of the Racer reasoner. Our new dialogue specification language (DSL) is a set of Common Lisp macros, a Domain Specific Language, which facilitates customer participation in the modeling process. The resulting dialogue models are also very concise. The DSL is a new modeling layer on top of our ontology-based Dialogue Management (DM) framework OntoVPA. We explain the rationale and benefits behind the new language, and support our claims with concrete reduced Level-of-Effort (LOE) numbers from two recent OntoVPA projects.")

             :description "Developers frequently make code changes while programming, such as deleting a line of code and renaming or introducing a variable. These changes can be detected and logged, for example by the IDE used by the developer. Logging changes is possible at two levels: at the textual level or at the level of the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the program. The logged changes, in both forms, are useful because they can be used to build new software engineering tools, such as static code analysers.

Plugins that log changes have already been developed for some IDEs. However, so far, no change-logging plugin has been developed for the DrRacket IDE, which supports the development of programs written in Scheme-like languages such as R5RS Scheme and Racket.
To fill this gap, we have developed RacketLogger, a change-logging plugin for DrRacket.
RacketLogger logs changes both at the textual level and at the AST level.
To determine changes at the level of the AST, we have adapted Negara et al.'s algorithm to support Scheme syntax.
We have evaluated our plugin by creating a visualisation for the logged changes to measure how well RacketLogger can be used as a building block, and conducted a small-scale user study to measure its usability.")
